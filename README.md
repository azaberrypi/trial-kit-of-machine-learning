# image-machine-learning-via-slack

## Summary
You can experience how machine learning works easily via VGG16, a trained model, and Slack, a communication platform.  
Get an image posted at Slack's particular channel by a user predict what is it with VGG16 and return a result of prediction to the user.

You can have other fun with this, such as changing a trained model.
  
Because I have developed it assuming that used by someone, I paid attention to UX and handling tokens.
